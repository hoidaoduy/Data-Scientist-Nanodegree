# Decoding Seattle's Airbnb Market: A Deep Dive into Pricing Factors

## Installations
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
 
No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Business Understanding
- Q1. During which months or seasons is it generally cheapest to book a hotel room in Seattle on Airbnb?
- Q2. What is the typical price range for hotel room listings on Airbnb in Seattle, and how does it vary by location within the city?
- Q3. What specific factors or amenities (such as room size, view, or proximity to attractions) tend to influence the price of hotel rooms on Airbnb in Seattle?

I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post in what is hopefully an engaging post which gives the reader insight into the questions posed. 

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Blog Post
